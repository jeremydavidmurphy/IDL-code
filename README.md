# IDL-code

This collection of code is written in IDL. Most of the routines were written by me during graduate school in astrophysics. Many of the routines include extensive comments which should help give you context for how they were used.

One set of routines is used to reduced data from an IFU fiber-fed spectrograph (VIRUS-P, or the Mitchell Spectrograph as it's now named). The primary routines are pipe1.pro and pipe2.pro which call several sub-rountines.

Another set of routines is designed to reduce data taken from a fiber optic test bench I built. Many of the tests were designed to calculate the focal ration degradation (FRD) on optical fibers we were considering for use on VIRUS-P.
